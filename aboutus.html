        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>Welcome to the <span class="highlight">District Institute of Education & Training (DIET), Chennai</span>, a
            premier institution dedicated to enhancing teacher education and educational excellence. Established in
            1991, DIET Chennai is located on the Lady Willingdon Campus at Kamarajar Salai, Triplicane, Chennai,
            directly across from Marina Beach. This location is not just scenic but historic, reflecting our commitment
            to an enduring legacy of quality in education.</p>

        <p>DIET Chennai was founded as part of a national initiative under the <span class="highlight">National Policy
                on Education, 1986</span>, which envisioned strong district-level institutions to uplift teacher
            training and foster educational development. We offer the <strong>Diploma in Teacher Education</strong>, a
            pre-service program recognized by the <strong>National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE)</strong>. This
            course aims to equip future educators with foundational skills and knowledge, setting them on a path toward
            successful careers in teaching.</p>

        <p>Our mission extends beyond initial teacher training. DIET Chennai collaborates closely with schools and the
            <span class="highlight">State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT)</span> to develop
            curriculum frameworks that meet the changing needs of students and align with national educational goals. We
            are committed to driving educational innovation, supporting schools with targeted training programs, and
            providing teachers with regular refresher courses, workshops, and seminars to foster continuous professional
            growth.</p>

        <p>Today, DIET Chennai is a recognized center for <span class="highlight">academic excellence and professional
                development</span> in Tamil Nadu. While our mission continues to evolve, our dedication to advancing
            education remains steadfast. We are proud to be an integral part of Indiaâ€™s educational landscape,
            continually shaping the future of learning in Chennai and beyond.</p>
